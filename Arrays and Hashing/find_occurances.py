# We are working on a security system for a badged-access room in our company's building.

# We want to find employees who badged into our secured room unusually often. We have an unordered list of names and entry times over a single day. Access times are given as numbers up to four digits in length using 24-hour time, such as "800" or "2250".

# Write a function that finds anyone who badged into the room three or more times in a one-hour period. Your function should return each of the employees who fit that criteria, plus the times that they badged in during the one-hour period. If there are multiple one-hour periods where this was true for an employee, just return the earliest one for that employee.

# badge_times = [
# ["Paul", "1355"],
# ["Jennifer", "1910"],
# ["John", "835"],
# ["John", "830"],
# ["Paul", "1315"],
# ["John", "1615"],
# ["John", "1640"],
# ["Paul", "1405"],
# ["John", "855"],
# ["John", "930"],
# ["John", "915"],
# ["John", "730"],
# ["John", "940"],
# ["Jennifer", "1335"],
# ["Jennifer", "730"],
# ["John", "1630"],
# ["Jennifer", "5"]
# ]

# Expected output (in any order)
# John: 830 835 855 915 930
# Paul: 1315 1355 1405

# n: length of the badge records array
